# What is Schizzy?
Schizzy is a person who has [schizoaffective disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoaffective_disorder) and loves computers, technology, hacking, hacktivism, and also trolling. 
I am an asshole, fully admitted, but also willing to teach people how to be safe on the internet, that is my main mission. 
I am 26 in human years and like to consider myself as an alien since I am on the spectrum and it's hard for me to convey messages through speech. 
Writing is a passion project, but truly I hate web development. 
It's the least fun part of the job, writing the blog and doing the HTML/CSS/SCSS/etc is boring as fuck to me. 
Also sorry this is not kid friendly, and I never intended it to be. 
This is my own thoughts and actions being put on to screen. You don't even have to pay for this, it's free and open sourced software. 
I make my own money doing stocks and options trading.
