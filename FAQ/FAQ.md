# Why the username?

I have a mental illness known as schizoaffective disorder. I sometimes hallucinate, hear voices in my head, and unfortunately have had some pretty dark times because of it. Still, it is a part of me and I cannot change it, so I try to embrace it and tackle it head on.

# Background?

Just a huge nerd tbh. Haven't had much in the way of professional coding, did a few projects with friends but other than that, this is mainly a solo project.

I also just really love technology, been tinkering for many years on my own devices and learning a lot in the process.
I taught, with some exceptions myself how to code by just reading a lot and YouTube tutorials, once you get past that stage you can really learn just about anything.

# Goals and aspirations?

Be a malware analyst at some security operations center.

# How do I contact?

If you have questions about the blog, and or bug reports (admittedly I make a lot of them), just create an issue and/or pull request.
Otherwise, don't :)

# What is an ethical hacker?

Well, ethics will vary from person to person but I have my own moral code.
I personally am no longer religious, I was raised Catholic but then one day I actually tried to read the Bible front to back and even on the fist page I was really lost when it came to how the flow and all that was structured.

# Favorite movie?

Well, there's a bunch but at the moment, the cult classic HACKERS from 1995 is a great film.

# Favorite band?

Same as above, but ones I listen to are mostly punk, punk rock, metal of various kinds, if I remember correctly I have about 1000 songs in one playlist.

# Favorite food?

BBQ. I love me a good slab of ribs, brisket, and my super favorite: pulled pork.
If interested I actually have a recipe from a buddy of mine to make a good pulled pork.

# Anything else?

Well, you tell me there. If you have more questions, I will respond to them (within reason) in due time.
